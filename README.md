# oauth2provider
An example that uses my fork of OAuth 2.0 provider based on [RangelReale's osin](https://github.com/rangelreale/osin). It runs on Google App Engine frontend and Datastore API.

The forked library is located [here](https://github.com/credli/osin).

### To run the example
Download and install Google App Engine SDK (golang) from [this source](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads/#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Go), then cd to your working directory and run:

```
$ goapp serve
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080/app using your browser.
